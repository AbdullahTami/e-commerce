E-COMMERCE APPLICATION

This e-commerce store project showcases my ability to use recent frontend technologies and pixel perfect methods to create high-quality web applications.\

I've used Redux Toolkit global state management library in order to optimize performance through preventing wasted renders.\

I've also used Styled Components to customize the app appearance and went for React Router for building the application routing.\

The filtering and sorting functionality were implemented by storing state in the URL through query params in order to make it globally accessible throughout the entire application.\

I've integrated a modal using the compound component pattern.\

I've also chosen to prioritize user experience through optimizing bundle size using lazy loading functionality as well as simulating quasi-backend calls using API functions.\

Finally, I tried to put some efforts into implementing authentication experience for users with creative password validations.\
